# Research Catalogue
## Quick Start Guide

## Registration, Profile & Adding Research

1. The Research Catalogue is at <https://www.researchcatalogue.net>

2. Either login or register for an account. (Note: as part of the
   account registration process, a signed form and proof of identity
   have to be sentby mail to the Society for Artistic Research. See
   <http://www.researchcatalogue.net/portal/register>
   

3. After logging in, click on **my profile** and **edit profile** to
   enter or update your personal data.

4. Click on **CREATE EXPOSITION** at the bottom of the profile page to
   create a new research exposition. A popover form opens. Here you
   can choose your editor: *text-based* - for simple blog style
   articles or *graphical editor* - a more poster-like format.
   
   You will also need to at least provide a title, copyright and
   abstract. This guide will demonstrate the graphical editor so
   choose that, and click __SUBMIT__.

## Workspace

5. After having clicked SUBMIT the workspace editor opens. You can
   always navigate back to your profile by clicking the person icon in
   the top right.
   
   Key areas in the workspace are
   - The grid (large rastered area in the center of the window)
   - Tools (the row of icons on the top of the screen)
   - Content Manager (a set of tabs consisting of)
	 * Simple media & Works - your RC media repository
	 * Pages - a list of pages
	 * Overview - a map and list of tools
	 * Footnotes - a list of popovers used in the exposition
	 
## Tools

6. Enter a first piece of text by dragging the leftmoost tool onto the
   canvas.  You can directly start writing text. Clicking outside the
   green border will save the content.
   
7. If you want to add other media than text to the page, you can do
    that in two ways: __Method 1)__ Drag any of the other tools from
    the toolbar onto your canvas. A dialog will open and here you can
    click "Add media" to upload the file.  After the upload is
    finished, click submit.
	
	TIP: make sure you upload your video in the **VIDEO** field and
    pdf in **PDF** field and not in **PREVIEW**. **PREVIEW** is just
    an image to represent the media in your exposition page before the
    reader clicks on it to start the video or open the pdf. A PREVIEW
    image is not required, if ommited, it will be generated
    automatically.
	
	__Method 2)__ Go to the media tab and click the |upload button| to
	select a media file on your computer for upload. Because the RC
	transcodes all media files, it may take a moment for bigger files
	to become available. Once converted, you can drag them to your
	workspace as if they were a tool.

8. Basic operations with a tool on a page:
   - Move: click on and drag the tool to a different place on the
     page.
   - Edit: double click a tool
   - Scale: move your mouse to the green border of a tool until the
     pointer changes to an arrow; click and drag the border of the
     tool to the desired size.
   - Delete: Select a tool with a single click. By right clicking on
     it you can select DELETE from the menu.  On all tools other than
     the text tool, you can also doubel click them and than click
     **DELETE TOOL** button.
   - Lock: Select a tool with a single click; the border will turn
     green indicating that the tool is selected. If you now right
     click the tool you can choose Lock.  Locking means that the tool
     can no longer be moved or its content changed.
	 
9. Add as many tools as you like to the page. To see how your page
   looks when it is viewed by the reader, click |PREVIEW| in the upper
   right corner of your window. A new tab will open in your browser
   where you will be able to view your page without any of the edit
   controls. Keeping this tab open, go back to your workspace and make
   some cahgnes. Clicking preview again will reresh the page.

## Pages

10. The page you initially worked with is the default page. You can
	add further pages to your research exposition, by clicking the +
	sign within the PAGES tab. By default, a new page will not be
	added to the TABLE OF CONTENTS.  You will need to add it yourself
	by going to options "edit table of content".

11. A page will grow automatically when you add more content, so it
	will never get too small.  Scrollbars will appear to navigate the
	larger page. Sometimes it can be useful to add an empty text tool
	at the margins of your content, as to allow the user to scroll a
	bit further than the content.
	
12. In the RC, hyperlinks allow you to make connections between one
    part of your research exposition and another, clicking on a
    hyperlinked piece of text for example, might lead you to a
    footnote or image on another part of the page, or on another page
    entirely. To create a hyperlink, scroll to the position on the
    page you want to navigate to (the hyperlinktarget) and a message
    will appear from which you should copy the URL, usually by
    right-click and selecting 'copy link location'.
	
	The URL should look something like this:
    http://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/12345/12345/50/150 \ where
    '50' indicates the number of pixels from the left border and '150'
    indicates the number of pixels from the top of the canvas.
	
13. Creating the hyperlink: add a new text tool or double-click on an
    existing one to edit the text of this tool. Highlight a character,
    word or string of words in your text and click on the chain symbol
    in your tool bar. Paste the previously copied URL into 'Link URL'
    and press insert.
	
## The repository

14. Click on Media in tab to view your previously uploaded media
    files.

15. Within the Media tab, you can also view your __WORKS__.  A work in
	the RC consists of a folder of media and metadata that can be used
	to represent an artwork or research result.  Compared to
	simple-media, works have the option to be shared between different
	expositions and can also be displayed as standalone objects on
	your profile.
	
16. To create a work, first click the WORK tab, then click the +
	symbol.  You can now fill in a number of metadata fields: title,
	type, date, author and copyright are obligatory the rest is
	optional.  Click submit. You can now add media files in the MEDIA
	tab of the same dialog.

17. To use the media within the WORK in your exposition, click WORKS
    tab within MEDIA and open the folder by clicking the + left of the
    works' title.  You can now drag the media files within the work
    and add them as tools to your canvas.


## Sharing, publishing, submitting

18. When you are finished with editing your exposition click the
    ![profile icon] in the menu to return to your profile page.  Your
    exposition will be listed under "Research Expostions".
	
19. On the object use â˜° to open the object menu:
    - change layout : change the appearance of your object on your
      profile
	- edit workspace : open the workspace editor
	- edit details : change the title, abstract and other metadata of
	  the exposition You can also invite other RC users to collaborate
	  through this dialog's COLLABORATION TAB.
	- share : use this menu to share work in progress with users
      within your portal, the RC or outside through a "magic" link.
	- self-publish : lock all content from changes and officially
      publish the exposition. This will create a DOI. WARNING: you
      will never be able to change the content of this exposition
	- submit for publication : submit your exposition to one of RC's
      portals (be sure to check their submission policy before doing
      this).
	- add to shortcut : create a small hyperlink to this exposition
	- connect to portal : create a connection between the exposition
      and a portal. This will require the portal admin to accept your
      request before the connection is confirmed.
	- manage versions : save and restore snapshots of
      expositions. Note this even works for published expositions, so
      this can also be used to create a new version of your
      exposition.
	- export : export your exposition as a zip of HTML files (may take
      a while).
	- delete : delete your exposition
