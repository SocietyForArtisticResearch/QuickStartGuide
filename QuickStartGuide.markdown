## Registration, Profile & Adding Research

1. The Research Catalogue is at <https://www.researchcatalogue.net>

2. Either login or register for an account. There are two types of accounts in RC, *limited* and *full* accounts. 
   Only *full* accounts are enabled to publish content.

   Important: if you are either a student or staff member at an affiliated portal partner
   ([list](https://societyforartisticresearch.org/about/institutional-members/) ),
   you should get your *full* RC account by requesting it directly at your
   local portal admin.
   
   If you are an independent researcher, you can follow the normal registration steps here:
   <http://www.researchcatalogue.net/portal/register>
   
   Tip: if you ever forget or loose your password, you can reset it using your email adres:
   <https://www.researchcatalogue.net/portal/forgotten-password>.
   

3. After logging in, click on **my profile** and **edit profile** to
   enter or update your personal data.

4. Click on <span class="rc-button">CREATE EXPOSITION</span> at the
   bottom of the profile page to create a new research exposition. A
   form will where you can choose your editor: 
   * *text-based* - for blog-style articles with inline media
   * *graphical editor* - a poster-like format that allows for
     non-linear layouts
   
   This guide will work with the *graphical editor* so choose that.\
   *To learn more about the text based editor, click
   [here](https://guide.researchcatalogue.net/#text-based-editor).*
   
   You will also need to provide a title, copyright and
   abstract. Don't worry too much about the abstract now, you can
   change it later.
   
   When everything is filled in, click <span
   class="rc-button">SUBMIT</span>. 
   
   
    
   

## Workspace

5. After having clicked <span class="rc-button">SUBMIT</span> the
   *workspace editor* opens. You can always navigate back to your
   profile by clicking the <img class="inline-icon"
   src="img/profile-icon.png"> in the top right.
   
   Key areas in the *workspace* are
   - The grid (large rastered area in the center of the window)
   - Tools (the row of icons on the top of the screen)
   - Content Manager (a set of tabs consisting of)
	 * Simple media & Works - your RC media repository
	 * Pages - a list of pages
	 * Overview - a map of the current weave and list of tools
	 * Footnotes - a list of popovers used in the exposition
	 
## Tools

6. Enter a first piece of text by dragging a *simple text tool* ( <img src="img/text-tool-icon.png" class="inline-icon"> ) onto the
   canvas.  You can directly start writing text. Clicking outside the
   tool will save the content. 
   
   For more extensive text editing, use the *HTML tool* (<img src="img/html-tool-icon.png" class="inline-icon"> ).
   
7. If you want to add other media than text to the page, you can do
    that in two ways: 
	
	__Method 1)__\
	
	Drag any of the other tools from
    the toolbar onto your canvas. A dialog will open and here you can
    click __"add media"__ to upload a media file into the tool.  After the upload is
    finished, click <span class="rc-button">submit</span>. 
	
	For video and audio, the RC will first transcode the file, before it is displayed.
	So wait a bit and refresh the page to see if it is there.
	
	TIP regarding video and pdf: make sure you upload your video in
    the **VIDEO** field and pdf in **PDF** field and not in
    **PREVIEW**. **PREVIEW** is just an image to represent the media
    in your exposition page before the reader clicks on it to start
    the video or open the pdf. A PREVIEW image is not required, if
    ommited, it will be generated automatically.
	
	__Method 2)__\
	
	Go to the media tab and click the |upload button| to
	select a media file on your computer for upload. Because the RC
	transcodes all media files, it may take a moment for bigger files
	to become available. Once converted, you can drag them to your
	workspace as if they were a tool.

8. Basic operations with a tool on a page:
   - move: click on and drag the tool to a different place on the
     page.
   - edit: double click a tool
   - scale: move your mouse to the green border of a tool until the
     pointer changes to an arrow; click and drag the border of the
     tool to the desired size.
   - delete: Select a tool with a single click. By right clicking on
     it you can select DELETE from the menu.  On all tools other than
     the text tool, you can also doubel click them and than click
      <span class="rc-button">DELETE TOOL</span> button.
   - lock: Select a tool with a single click; the border will turn
     green indicating that the tool is selected. If you now right
     click the tool you can choose Lock.  Locking means that the tool
     can no longer be moved or its content changed.
	 
9. Add as many tools as you like to the page. To see how your page
   looks when it is viewed by the reader, click <img
   src="img/preview-icon.png" class="inline-icon"> in the upper right
   corner of your window. A new tab will open in your browser where
   you will be able to view your page without any of the edit
   controls. Keeping this tab open, go back to your workspace and make
   some changes. Clicking preview again will reresh the page.
 

## Pages

10. The page you initially worked with is the default page. You can
	add further pages to your research exposition, by clicking the +
	sign within the __PAGES__ tab. By default, a new page will not be
	added to the __TABLE OF CONTENTS__.  You will need to add it yourself
	by going to options "edit table of content".

11. The RC canvas will grow automatically when you add more content, 
    the edge of your canvas will be where the furthest tool is positioned. 
	
12. In the RC, hyperlinks allow you to make connections between one
    part of your research exposition and another, clicking on a
    hyperlinked piece of text for example, might lead you to a
    footnote or image on another part of the page, or on another page
    entirely. To create a hyperlink, scroll to the position on the
    page you want to navigate to (the hyperlink target) and choose
    menu __options -> show current position__. A message will
    appear from which you should copy the URL, usually by right-click
    and selecting 'copy link location'.
	
	The URL will look something like this:
    http://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/12345/12345/50/150 \ where
    '50' indicates the number of pixels from the left border and '150'
    indicates the number of pixels from the top of the canvas.
	
13. Creating the hyperlink in your exposition: add a new text tool or
    double-click on an existing one to edit the text of this
    tool. Highlight any text or even single character in your text and
    click on the hyperlink button 
	(<img src="img/chain-icon.png"
    class="inline-icon">). Paste the previously copied URL into
    'Link URL' and press __insert__.
	
## The repository

14. Click on __media__ to the right side of your canvas to view your
    previously uploaded media files.

15. Within the Media tab, you can also view your *works*.  A *work* in
	the RC consists of a collection of media files and metadata that can be used
	to represent an artwork or research result. Compared to
	simple media, works have the option to be shared between different
	expositions and can also be displayed as standalone objects on
	your profile.
	
16. To create a work, first click the __work__ tab, then click the __+__
	symbol.  You can now fill in a number of metadata fields: title,
	type, date, author and copyright are obligatory the rest is
	optional.  Click submit. You can now add media files in the MEDIA
	tab of the same dialog.

17. To use media that is contained in a __work__ in your exposition,
    go to your works in your media repository and open the folder by
    clicking the __+__ left of the works' title.  You can now drag the
    media files within the work and add them as tools to your canvas.


## Sharing, publishing, submitting

18. When you are finished with editing your exposition click the <img
    class="inline-icon" src="img/profile-icon.png"> in the menu to
    return to your profile page.  Your exposition will be listed under
    "Research Expostions".
	
19. On the exposition, use <span class="bigger-text">☰</span> to open the object menu:
    - change layout : change the appearance of your object on your
      profile
	- edit workspace : open the workspace editor
	- edit details : change the title, abstract and other metadata of
	  the exposition. Here you can also invite other RC users to collaborate
	  through this dialog's __COLLABORATION__ tab.
	- share : use this menu to share work in progress with users
      within your portal, the RC or outside through a "magic" link.
	- self-publish : lock all content from changes and officially
      publish the exposition. This will create a DOI. __WARNING__: you
      will never be able to change the content of this exposition after it is published.
	  It will be fixed as a permanent reference.
	- submit for publication : submit your exposition to one of RC's
      portals (be sure to check their submission policy before doing
      this).
	- add to shortcut : create a small hyperlink to this exposition
	- connect to portal : create a connection between the exposition
      and a portal. This will require the portal admin to accept your
      request before the connection is confirmed.
	- manage versions : save and restore snapshots of
      expositions. Note this even works for published expositions, so
      this can also be used to create a new version of your
      exposition.
	- export : export your exposition as a zip of HTML files (may take
      a while).
	- delete : delete your exposition
